This README.md file for the SACCO Management System project. This README will help explain the project, its purpose, and provide setup instructions for running the SQL scripts.

SACCO Management System

## Project Overview

The SACCO Management System is a database solution designed to manage the operations of a Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization (SACCO). It allows for the management of members, their contributions, loans, loan repayments, and account transactions. The project aims to demonstrate practical applications of SQL skills and database design principles by creating a relational database to handle the key aspects of SACCO management.

Features

Member Management: Store and retrieve information about members.
Account Management: Track different types of accounts (Savings, Current) for members.
Contributions Tracking: Record and manage contributions made by members.
Loan Management: Manage loans issued to members and track their repayment status.
Transaction Management: Track deposits and withdrawals for each member's account.
Reporting: Generate reports summarizing key metrics like total contributions, loan statuses, and transaction summaries.

## Setup Instructions

1. Prerequisites
To set up and run this project, ensure you have the following:

PostgreSQL installed on your system.
Access to a PostgreSQL client or command line interface to run SQL scripts.
Basic understanding of SQL and database management.
2. Database Setup
Step 1: Create the Database

Open your PostgreSQL client or command line interface.
Create a new database using:
CREATE DATABASE sacco_management;
3. onnect to the newly created database:
sql
Copy code
\c sacco_management
Step 2: Create Tables

Execute the Create_Tables.sql file to create the necessary tables:
bash
Copy code
psql -U <username> -d sacco_management -f Create_Tables.sql
Step 3: Populate Tables with Sample Data

Run the Populate_Tables.sql file to insert sample data into the tables:
bash
Copy code
psql -U <username> -d sacco_management -f Populate_Tables.sql
3. Running Queries
Open the Queries.sql file to see example queries that can be used for data retrieval, analysis, and reports.
You can run any of these queries directly in your PostgreSQL client:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Members;
4. Generating Reports
Use the Reports.sql script to generate key reports:
bash
Copy code
psql -U <username> -d sacco_management -f Reports.sql
The Reports.sql file includes SQL queries that will summarize:
Total contributions per member
Total and outstanding loans by member
Average loan repayment amounts
Transaction summaries for accounts
Example Queries

To retrieve information about a member’s contributions:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    m.first_name, 
    m.last_name, 
    SUM(c.amount) AS total_contributions
FROM Members m
JOIN Contributions c ON m.member_id = c.member_id
GROUP BY m.first_name, m.last_name;
